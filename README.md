### About the project:

This app has a homepage that displays the basics of each pet posted on Pet Seeker Palooza. Users can click through into individual pets, and also upload new pets into the Pet Seeker Palooza database to be stored for other users to interact with. 

Future developmet plans include adding a search funciton to allow users to peruse the pets on the app, searching for characteristics they want in pets, an ability to favorite animals, and more species options.
